                  <b>GABUS PUCUNG </b> <br />
                  Gabus Pucung is part of the Betawi culinary tradition,
                  reflecting the rich culture of the local community. The name
                  "pucung" refers to kluwek as the main ingredient for its
                  broth.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                  This dish used to be very popular in areas around Jakarta and
                  Depok because gabus (snakehead fish) was abundant in local
                  waters. The black color of the broth comes from kluwek, the
                  seed of the kepayang tree, which gives a unique, savory, and
                  slightly earthy flavor.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                  Gabus Pucung is best enjoyed warm with white rice. This dish
                  offers a distinctive taste that combines savory, slightly
                  bitter, and deep spices, making it perfect for lovers of
                  traditional Indonesian food.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                  If you have the opportunity, tasting Gabus Pucung in its place
                  of origin will provide an authentic culinary experience!

                <b>DAGE</b> <br />
                Dage is a traditional food commonly found in Depok. It is a
                simple preparation made from tofu, tempeh, or other fermented
                soybean products, fried in a seasoned flour batter. Dage is a
                popular snack in traditional markets because of its distinctive
                savory taste and affordable price.
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                The dage sold in Depok is often made from local tempeh bungkil
                (a by product of soybean processing), giving it a slightly
                richer flavor and denser texture compared to regular tempeh.
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Its simple yet rich taste makes it a favorite among locals.
                Although simple, dage reflects the uniqueness of local cuisine,
                utilizing inexpensive yet delicious ingredients.
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">

                <b>BIR PLETOK</b> <br />
                Bir Pletok is a traditional Betawi beverage that is also
                well-known in surrounding areas such as Depok. Despite its name
                containing the word "beer," this drink contains no alcohol at
                all. Bir Pletok is a blend of spices known for its warming
                sensation, fragrant aroma, and health benefits.
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                The inspiration for this drink came from Dutch colonial
                influences that introduced the tradition of drinking beer. The
                local community then created their own healthier and
                alcohol-free version using traditional ingredients. The name
                "Pletok" is believed to come from the sound "pletok," which is
                heard when ice cubes are added to the drink, especially when
                served cold.
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Bir Pletok is suitable for enjoyment in various settings,
                especially at night or in cold weather. This beverage is often
                served at traditional Betawi events such as weddings or
                celebrations and is a popular souvenir from Depok.
